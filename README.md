Ecostruxre Automation Expert Starter Templates

## Before you begin
We assume basic know-how with Git. If you don't have that know-how (yet), we recommand you use Github Desktop.

## How to use
From [this page]([https://github.schneider-electric.com/eae-acc/starter]) hit the "Use this template button" and follow the instructions.
The default template is a v24.1 Starter Kit for Multi OS. You will need to rename the solution and adapt hmi support in EAE based on your needs.
After confirmation you will be redirected to your newly created Github repository. You can open it locally by hitting the "Code" button as shown below.
