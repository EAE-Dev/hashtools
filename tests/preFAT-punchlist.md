**Project Name**: [Insert Project Name]  
**Date**: [Insert Date]  
**Prepared by**: [Insert Name]  
**FAT Scheduled Date**: [Insert Date]

This punchlist outlines tasks and checks to be completed before the Factory Acceptance Test (FAT) to ensure the industrial automation system is ready for commissioning.

## 1. Hardware Verification
- [ ] Confirm all hardware components (PLCs, HMIs, sensors, actuators) are installed per design specifications.
- [ ] Verify wiring connections are secure and labeled correctly.
- [ ] Check power supply voltages meet system requirements (e.g., 24VDC, 120VAC).
- [ ] Inspect enclosures for proper sealing and IP rating compliance.
- [ ] Test I/O modules for signal integrity (digital and analog signals).
- [ ] Ensure redundancy systems (if applicable) are functional.
- [ ] Verify grounding and shielding to prevent electrical noise.

**Open Issues**:
- [ ] *List any unresolved hardware issues here*

## 2. Software and Configuration
- [ ] Confirm PLC firmware and software versions match project requirements.
- [ ] Upload and verify the latest program version to the PLC.
- [ ] Test HMI screens for functionality and correct data display.
- [ ] Validate communication protocols (e.g., Modbus, Ethernet/IP) between devices.
- [ ] Check alarm configurations and ensure they trigger as expected.
- [ ] Verify data logging and historian setup (if applicable).
- [ ] Perform a backup of all software and configurations.

**Open Issues**:
- [ ] *List any unresolved software issues here*

## 3. Functional Testing
- [ ] Simulate inputs to verify correct outputs (e.g., valve opens when commanded).
- [ ] Test interlocks and safety functions to ensure proper operation.
- [ ] Run system in manual mode to confirm control functionality.
- [ ] Test automatic sequences for correct execution and timing.
- [ ] Verify fail-safe conditions and system response to power loss.
- [ ] Check integration with upstream/downstream systems (if applicable).

**Open Issues**:
- [ ] *List any unresolved functional issues here*

## 4. Documentation
- [ ] Confirm all drawings (P&ID, electrical schematics, I/O lists) are up-to-date.
- [ ] Verify availability of user manuals for hardware and software.
- [ ] Ensure FAT test procedures are documented and approved.
- [ ] Check that all change requests or deviations are recorded.
- [ ] Prepare a list of spare parts and verify availability.

**Open Issues**:
- [ ] *List any unresolved documentation issues here*

## 5. Safety and Compliance
- [ ] Verify emergency stop buttons and safety circuits are operational.
- [ ] Confirm compliance with relevant standards (e.g., IEC 61131, NFPA 79).
- [ ] Check for proper labeling of hazardous areas and components.
- [ ] Ensure lockout/tagout provisions are in place.
- [ ] Verify operator safety features (e.g., guards, light curtains) are functional.

**Open Issues**:
- [ ] *List any unresolved safety issues here*

## 6. General Checks
- [ ] Clean and organize the system for inspection.
- [ ] Verify all tools and test equipment are calibrated and available for FAT.
- [ ] Confirm attendance of key personnel for FAT (client, vendor, engineers).
- [ ] Review punchlist items from previous inspections (if applicable).

**Open Issues**:
- [ ] *List any unresolved general issues here*

## Notes
- Add any specific customer requirements or project-specific tasks here.
- Schedule a pre-FAT review meeting to close open issues.
- Update this punchlist during FAT preparation as needed.
